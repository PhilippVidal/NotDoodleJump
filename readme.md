A small game based on Doodle Jump, created within a single week while following a set of rules and design guidelines. 
As a basis for the game a simple framework was provided that allowed for loading and rendering of sprites at a given screen position as well as basic input events. 
All remaining gameplay elements and mechanics were coded from scratch using C++, including garbage collection, collision detection and transforming the sprites from screen-space to world-space.<br>
Due to licensing/copyright the framework and the associated classes were omitted from this upload.
